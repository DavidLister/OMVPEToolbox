# OMVPEToolbox

A GUI tool for computing common quantities for OMVPE reactors.

## Goals

Calculate:
- Molar flow rate of OM
- Calculate V/III ratio
- Calculate gas partial pressures
- Solve equations in any direction (eg OM bubbler rate given desired V/III ratio)

Open and view many files:
- Import a .csv recipe file and run calculations
- Import a .csv run log file and run calculations
- Plot data from a logged run
- Visualize a recipe file
- Open saved xrd files
- Open and analyze rtlr files

Features
- Save software state so that it's easy to open and get running
